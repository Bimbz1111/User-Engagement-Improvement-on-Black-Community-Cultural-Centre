**Product Objectives**
BCCCC is a non-profit Canadian company website that is focused on promoting awareness, cultural values, collaboration among newcomers and other black owned start-ups through newcomer settlement, youth development and capacity-building in technology.

**The problem space**
BCCCC aims to enhance user engagement and expand its digital platform to better serve newcomers and Black-led organizations. There is a clear need for a tech-enabled solution that promotes collaboration across member organizations that increases visibility, and shared resources platform that ensures accessible pathways to mentorship, IT skill development, leadership training, and employment readiness among newcomers which is critical to successful settlement and long-term inclusion.

**what i did**

I gathered the product requirements by asking black immigrants through interview sessions on what they might need.

I aligned the requirements with the user objectives

I developed use cases, test cases and user scenrarios to understand further the user needs

I developed the digital value statement and the digital product opportunity.

I also developed a process flow chart that can align with the engineering teams technical specification

I collaborated with the engineering team to investigate the technical feasibility of the objectives

I developed a business case to showcase the stakeholder and the risk assesment.

I also check for the ethical side of the product so that it can user can be protected

I developed the product roadmap that contained the product vision,product scope, product strategies and presented it to the excecutives and it served as a living document to prevent scope creep.

I developed a marketing scale plan that would work perfectly for the product launch which include product marketing on social media, product pricing was not included because it is a non profit organization however a digital value proposition was developed to position the product properly for newcomers.
The product will soon be launched and we can have new features on the website. This is done through Tech connect nb Moncton initiative.
